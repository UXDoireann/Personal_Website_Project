			     The choice of one of the columns with the composite capitals from the interior of City Hall
			     is significant.<u> John Summerson, </u>the eminent architectural historian, noted how architects of
			     the 18th century often chose that style of capital to “lay it on thick”, to express luxury,
			     opulence and a sense of “no expense spared”. Indeed, those seen at City Hall, carved by
			     Simon Vierpyl, with their massive volutes, ornate acanthus leaves and intricate engravings,
				   really exemplify the intent mood of the Royal Exchange when it was originally built.
			     Built in 1779 by <u>Thomas Cooley,</u> the Royal Exchange was the first large-scale Neoclassical
			     building in Ireland, seeng standards at the time of design ambition, lavishness and style.

		<p class="extra_text">
			     Dublin, occupying a significant economic role in the British Empire saw the Royal Exchange as
			     the first of a number of superlative civic buildings in the city during the late 18th century, eg.
			     The Newcomen Bank, the Four Courts, the Customs House among others. These grand,
			     spectacular buildings were politically strategic gestures by Westminster and Dublin Castle to
			     win parliamentary support and were seen as extravagant, show-off pieces to promote their
			     interests and display power and wealth.</p>
		<p class="more_text"> However, the Royal Exchange, when it was completed, in many ways, it failed as a building.
			     Firstly, the design related to a mode of interaction and exchange typical of merchants in
			     Europe, but the merchants in Dublin didn’t really inhabit the vast ambulatory space as
			     intended, as their mode of dealing with each other was just different. Moreover, once the
			     new Customs House was relocated down the Liffey in 1780, the focus area in the city for
			     trade and commerce followed suite. Not long after, came the Act of Union which decimated
			     Dublin economically. Capital literally left the Royal Exchange, went down the river and away.
			     I imagine this as an over-inflated classical column that suddenly has a release of air and starts
			     to collapse in on itself. Parallels can be drawn between history and economic collapse in
			     contemporary times when over-confidence in building and development is subsequently
			     dashed by unforeseen forces, with a subsequent re-evaluation of “what really matters”.
			     “Our Capital” will also mimic the aged white marble of the statues in the interior rotunda.
			     Instead of being completely white, there will be very subtle accents of bright colours -
			     intended to deliberately disrupt the fixation of ‘whiteness’ in such statuary - with all its
			     implied values. </p>
